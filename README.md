# OncoEng
OncoEng centres on a transformational and systems engineering approach Metastatic Bone Disease (MBD) in the spine using a framework combining advanced image-based modelling and cutting edge manufacturing to enable an optimised, metamaterial-based minimally invasive implant (MII). Long-term patient impact will be enabled by partnership with the industry and healthcare sectors, as well as other globally leading academic units.

Researchers will develop new approaches to patient imaging and computer modelling, enabling them to track tumour development in the spine over time and how it might be weakening individual vertebrae.

The information would be compared with the loading on the spine, enabling clinicians to predict which of the vertebrae is at risk of fracturing.

Finally a new medical device will be developed to enable treatment of vertebrae at a high-risk of collapse to be supported by an implant inserted into the spine using minimally invasive techniques.
